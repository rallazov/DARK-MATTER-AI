# Privacy

## Core Policy

- No user vault data is used for model training.
- Data stays user-scoped by `vaultId` and user ownership checks.
- Users can export data at any time in JSON/CSV.
- Users can trigger irreversible vault reset with explicit confirmation.

## Compliance Notes

- GDPR/CCPA-oriented controls: export, erase, transparent audit logs.
- Privacy score nudges help users improve configuration hygiene (MFA, key rotation).
- Collaboration links are encrypted and implemented as zero-knowledge approximation flow.
