# Product UX

## Psychology Patterns

- Fast signup (OAuth or magic link) minimizes first-session friction.
- Onboarding in 3 steps for momentum and control.
- Streaks + badges create positive reinforcement loops.
- Private productivity insights visualize personal gain.
- Gentle scarcity and progress nudges support retention without deception.

## Ethical Guardrails

- Nudges are dismissible and never dark-patterned.
- Privacy controls are explicit, plain-language, and reversible where possible.
- Destructive actions require clear irreversible confirmation.
